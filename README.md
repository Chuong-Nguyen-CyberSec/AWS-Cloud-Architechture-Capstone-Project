In this project, I designed an AWS architecture for a small business, implementing a scalable and highly available web application infrastructure. Key components include an Application Load Balancer in a public subnet to distribute HTTP traffic across multiple EC2 instances, an Auto Scaling group for dynamic scaling based on CPU usage, and an RDS instance with a multi-AZ MySQL setup for high availability. I also updated AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for secure management of credentials, configured security groups for SSH access via a Bastion Host, and created a NAT Gateway for secure internet access for private subnet resources. Additionally, I transferred SQL dump files to the RDS instance via SSH and attempted an RDS snapshot to S3 for backup, which was restricted due to account limitations.
